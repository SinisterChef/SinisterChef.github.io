                  ransitioning away from Salesforce into Slate, the entire admission process was rebuilt from scratch. With the help of a third party guiding the university, we accomplished this monumental task within ten months. My tasks include: branding, RFI forms, analytics, report building, and portal development into the new CRM.</p>

                  <h3>Admission Portals</h3>
                  <p>In this project, I was challenged with building a seamless user experience from the student's first intraction - a newly created Wright State University Admissions Apply Page - to the student receiving their decision letter. I accomplished this by developing multiple portals (landing pages with logic based content) which detailed what the student still needed to submit regarding their college admissions application process in order to recieve a decision from the university.</p>

                  <h3>Processes</h3>
                  <p>Coming to an entirely new CRM, my Google skills were put to the test. Using Slate's provided resources, testing environments, and community forum support, I picked up the neccessary knowledge to produce a seamless user experience that guides the student throughout their entire application process. Months of user testing helped develop the logic behind the application portal to assure the content is pertinent to student. What was originally multiple pages of student ID and account information in Salesforce was distilled down to a single block of clear and consise instructions.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>A couple of highlights</h4>
                  <p>Inspired by pizza (not surpisingly), I developed a <em>Pizza Tracker</em>-like progress bar to help the student visualize where they are in the application process.</p>
                  <p>I also created a report in Slate that was not possible in Salesforce originally. With this report, we can better track the impact of the main RFI. Cross-referencing application data and RFI submissions, we can see when the student first interacted with the RFI, if the student applied to the univeristy, the current status of their application, and state of acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Our hired third-party who specialize in Slate have noted the application portals of my design are the best they've seen. If they didn't know I was totally new to Slate, they would have expected someone with 5 years experience to be behind the portals.</p>
