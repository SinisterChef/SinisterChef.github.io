As an organizing committee member I was tasked with creating a website to represent the spirit of the festival, detail event specifics, create social media ads, and organize a system of communications between booth retailers and committee team members.</p>

        <h3>Processes</h3>
        <p>Working with a team of designers we developed a brand and logo using inspiration from 1900 barnhouse font styling; the same style the Wright brothers built their first glider in. Working with the Space and Airforce museum and Wright Brother Archives, I created a variety of imagery that focused on the innovation the festival was set to capture. Taking the brand elements developed by the design team and my imagery, I created a custom Wordpress theme and set up hosting for the event. Working with a few volunteers doing A/B testing, I created a site that accommodated all users interested in the event.

With the website in place I created a webform submission process behind a passworded section of the site for retailers to register to attend and sell their goods at the event. Using logic programming in the webform system, I created a pipeline dependent on the retailers submission information to make sure their submissions went to the correct peoples.</p>
