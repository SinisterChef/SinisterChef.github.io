                              <li>Executed front-end development across multiple enterprise-grade codebases for national brands including 7-Eleven, Speedway, Champion Windows, and Salon Lofts.</li>
                              <li>Developed and maintained scalable, performance-optimized web components within agile Scrum teams using ASP.NET Core, React, Ruby on Rails, and HAML.</li>

                              <li>Migrated Speedway.com from a .NET Core codebase to a headless CMS with a React front-end.

                           <ul class="curriculum-vitae-accomplishments">
                              <li>As a dedicated Web Developer and Designer at Wright State University for over a decade, I have played a pivotal role in crafting quality online, print, video user experience, and elevating the university’s brand recognition.</li>
                              <li>I aided in a total rebuild of the admission process for the university. The university moved from Salesforce to <a href="/slate.html" target="_blank">Slate</a>. I streamlined and overhauled a seamless user experience that guided the student through a handful of different systems. From their first RFI contact, to the student receiving their application decision letter, my portal and site theme designs are cohesively branded and constructed to provide a total visual uniformity while simultaneously supplying the student with all the information needed to apply and start their education at Wright State University.</li>
                              <li>Wanting to transition into a more specific <a href="/wright-state-university.html" target="_blank">user focused homepage</a> and away from a mix of messages for a variety of users, I was tasked to develop a new front door to the university specifically for one user in mind, Perspective Students. I reviewed analytic data over five years to better understand the website users and how they navigate the university website, who are they, how old are they, where they are, what devices are they using, etc. Compiling this knowledge, I produced a variety of user Personas that gave a visual representation of our users and their analytic data. Taking the prospective student persona through an iterative process I created a wireframe, mockup, and final design.</li>
                              <li>My design skills extend far from just Web Development. I maintain and update over 70 different <a href="/badges.html" target="_blank">badge illustrations</a> that are used in every facet of our advertising. Every month I produce an Instagram or TikTiok video motion graphic advertisement that is served to our digital social media audience of over two million views a year. I have made multiple murals on campus, my "Post Card" mural has become a popular attraction to all that visit and has become the main "Selfie" station for the entire university.</li>
